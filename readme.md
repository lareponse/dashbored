# Dashbored

Dashbored is not a dashboard framework.
It is not an admin generator.
It is not a product that assumes it already understands your work.

Dashbored is a **cognitive workspace** designed to let structure **emerge** instead of being imposed.

This documentation does not describe features.
It defines **constraints, responsibilities, and philosophy**.

If you are looking for:
- predefined schemas
- ready-made dashboards
- fixed workflows

You are in the wrong place.

## How to Read This Documentation

Each document addresses **one role**, **one responsibility**, **one mental model**.

You are not expected to read everything.

### If you are a…

- **Developer / DBA** → start with `ARCHITECTURE.md`, then `BACKEND.md`
- **UX / UI Designer** → read `MANIFESTO.md`, then `UI_UX.md`
- **Project Manager** → read `MANIFESTO.md`, then `PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT.md`
- **Client / Stakeholder** → read `CLIENT.md`
- **Core contributor** → read everything, in order

## Structure

- `MANIFESTO.md`  
  Why Dashbored exists. What it refuses to be.

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`  
  System-level rules: canonical vs emergent, promotion, constraints.

- `BACKEND.md`  
  How to implement without hiding complexity or breaking intent.

- `UI_UX.md`  
  Interface as a spatial, cognitive language — not decoration.

- `PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT.md`  
  How to manage a system where uncertainty is intentional.

- `CLIENT.md`  
  Plain-language explanation of what this tool is and why it behaves differently.

- `APPENDIX.md`  
  Shared vocabulary, clarifications, and recurring misunderstandings.

## A Warning (Intentional)

Dashbored resists:
- premature certainty
- over-configuration
- decorative interfaces
- hidden automation

This is not accidental.
This is the product.

If this feels uncomfortable at first, that is expected.
Dashbored is designed to **think with you**, not ahead of you.

Proceed accordingly.
