# UI/UX — dashbored Interface Doctrine

This document defines **how dashbored must feel, behave, and think**.

It is not a style guide.
It is not a component library.
It is not about colors, trends, or branding.

It defines a **cognitive interface language**.

If you design something that looks good but violates this document,  
the design is wrong.

## The Role of the Interface

dashbored’s interface is not a container for features.

It is a **thinking surface**.

Its job is not to:
- guide users through predefined paths
- optimize task completion speed
- explain itself through labels and menus

Its job is to:
- let users *see* structure
- let meaning *form spatially*
- let importance *emerge*
- let uncertainty *exist without apology*

The interface does not decide for the user.
It **thinks with them**.

---

## The UI Is a Spatial Language

dashbored does not use navigation.
It uses **position**.

Every element exists in space for a reason.
Nothing is decorative.
Nothing is arbitrary.

### Spatial Meaning

- **Center**  
  What currently matters. The active focus of thought.

- **Distance from center**  
  Relevance, not hierarchy.

- **Proximity between elements**  
  Relationship, not grouping by category.

- **Clusters**  
  Concepts that belong together *for now*.

- **Isolation**  
  Exploration, uncertainty, or unresolved meaning.

Space is not layout.
Space is **syntax**.

---

## Focus + Field Model

There is always:
- **one focus**
- **one field**

The focus is explicit.
The field is contextual.

Users do not move between pages.
They **shift attention**.

This mirrors how humans think:
one thing clearly,
many things vaguely.

If your design encourages scanning menus instead of shifting focus,
it is wrong.

## Shape Language Comes Before Text

Shapes in dashbored are **pre-semantic**.

They communicate *before* labels, icons, or words.

This is intentional.

### Shape Grammar (Example, Adaptable)

- **Square**  
  Stable entity. Something that has earned persistence.

- **Circle**  
  Process, flow, or ongoing activity.

- **Triangle**  
  Decision, tension, risk, or branching.

- **Hexagon**  
  Composite structure or higher-order meaning.

The exact mapping may evolve.
What must not change:
- few shapes
- consistent meaning
- learned through interaction
- no legend required

If you need to explain a shape with text, you failed.

---

## Letters Before Icons

Early-stage dashbored uses:
- letters
- simple glyphs
- abstract marks

Not icons.

Icons carry:
- cultural assumptions
- premature metaphors
- false familiarity

dashbored avoids pretending meaning is already known.

Icons may appear **only after**:
- repeated use
- stabilized meaning
- shared understanding

Abstraction first.
Metaphor later.
Maybe.

---

## Constraint Is a Feature

dashbored deliberately limits:
- number of visible elements
- number of relationships
- number of actions per focus
- number of shapes

This is not minimalism as an aesthetic.
It is **cognitive protection**.

Unlimited choice creates:
- anxiety
- noise
- loss of meaning

dashbored enforces limits so that:
- what remains matters
- structure must be intentional
- users are not overwhelmed

If your design feels “too open”, you removed constraints.
Put them back.

---

## Showing Time, Change, and Uncertainty

dashbored must visibly support:
- unfinished nodes
- weak relationships
- fading relevance
- experimental groupings
- structures that may disappear

Nothing must look falsely complete.

Avoid:
- hard borders for tentative things
- strong contrast for unstable elements
- visual confidence where conceptual confidence does not exist

This is a thinking tool, not a reporting dashboard.

---

## Motion Has Meaning

Motion is allowed only if it:
- expresses relationship
- expresses change
- expresses causality
- helps orientation

Motion must never be:
- decorative
- distracting
- constant
- playful for its own sake

If motion does not teach the user something,
remove it.

---

## Accessibility Is Structural, Not Optional

Accessibility is not a layer.
It is embedded in the grammar.

Rules:
- no meaning conveyed by color alone
- strong, visible focus states
- keyboard-first navigation possible
- predictable spatial behavior
- no time-based traps
- no hidden interactions

If an interface is cognitively clear,
it is usually accessible.
If it is visually clever but mentally confusing,
it is not.

---

## What dashbored UI Is Not

It is not:
- a dashboard of charts
- a sidebar with menus
- a grid of cards with filters
- a design system demo
- a productivity app clone

If your design looks familiar,
be suspicious.

---

## The Designer’s Responsibility

You are not decorating data.
You are **shaping thought**.

Your decisions:
- influence how meaning forms
- influence what users trust
- influence what becomes permanent

Treat this responsibility seriously.

When in doubt:
- remove
- simplify
- constrain
- make uncertainty visible

---

## Designer Checklist

Before validating any UI decision, ask:

- Does every position have meaning?
- Does every shape have a stable semantic role?
- Is the focus unambiguous?
- Are limits enforced?
- Is uncertainty visible?
- Is motion informative?
- Is accessibility structural?

If the answer is “no” to any of these,
the design is not ready.

## Closing

dashbored’s interface is quiet by design.
Not empty.
Not cold.
Quiet.

It leaves room for thought.
